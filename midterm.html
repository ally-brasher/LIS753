         <p> The Friends of Palo Alto Library host monthly book sales on the last Saturday of the month. We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies, along with items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.</p>
         <p> In the main room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents each.Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track,Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs and books for parents and teachers. </p>  
         <p>Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50
            cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are
            half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then
            filling these with books.</p>
         <p>You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we
            have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we
            give 100%. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people you’ll ever
            find.</p>  
         <p>You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.</p>
      <h2 class="subheading">Day of Sale Information</h2>
         <p>We have severe space limitations where we can only allow 160 people in the main room at a time so we have implemented a ticket system.</p>  
         <p>Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am and going until 11 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. The Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour before the Main Room. 
            Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your
            spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you
            will forfeit your place in line. If you don’t arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter
            part of the line.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases.after which they should purchase these and
            exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
            re-enter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
            remains outside</p>
      <h2 class="subheading">Directions</h2>
         <p>Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center
               (see map below). Please bring your large book donations to this room too.</p>
