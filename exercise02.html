<p>Hi! You said we could be creative with this so I am writing about my planning of my table top game this week. I run a game of Monster of the Week. My players have realized they can unionize against the mysteries I give them and they are doing that. This is great story wise because I have been trying to push them that fate isn’t as set as they’ve been led to believe. </p>
<p> This does mean I have to have lots of stuff ready for whatever they decide to do. It is kind of stressful but so much fun. </p>
